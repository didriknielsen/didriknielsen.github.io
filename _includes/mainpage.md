## About Me

I am currently a PhD student working on probabilistic deep generative models with Prof. [Ole Winther](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/winther/) at [DTU Compute](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english) in Copenhagen, Denmark. I also work part-time at the start-up [raffle.ai](http://raffle.ai/), developing corporate virtual assistants using information retrieval, natural language processing and deep learning.

Previously, I was working at [AIP](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) at RIKEN in Tokyo, Japan with [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) on methods for approximate Bayesian inference.

For more details, see my full [CV](/files/cv.pdf).

## Research Interests

I am interested in *probabilistic machine learning* methods, including the development and evaluation of probabilistic models, as well as design of approximate inference methods.
