I joined the RIKEN [Center for Advanced Intelligence Project](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) as a research assistant, where I will be working with [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) in the [Approximate Bayesian Inference Team](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/generic_tech/approx_bayes_infer/).
