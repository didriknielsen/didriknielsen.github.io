## About Me

Staff Machine Learning Engineer at [twig.energy](https://www.twig.energy/) developing machine learning models for trading in power markets -- enabling higher revenues for producers and unlocking zero carbon power for consumers.

In my PhD, I worked on *deep generative models*, including *normalizing flows* and *diffusion models* with Prof. [Ole Winther](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/winther/) at [DTU Compute](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english).

For more details, see my full [CV](/files/cv.pdf) or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-sbw1JIAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Interests

I am broadly interested in machine learning and deep learning. I have previously worked on deep generative models, probabilistic inference approaches and boosting methods.
