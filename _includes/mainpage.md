## About Me

PhD student working on Unsupervised Deep Learning with Prof. [Ole Winther](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/winther/) at [DTU Compute](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english). My research so far has mostly focused on *normalizing flows* and their connection to VAEs, PixelCNNs and other methods. 

Previously, I was working at RIKEN [AIP](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) in Tokyo, Japan with [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) on methods for approximate Bayesian inference.

For more details, see my full [CV](/files/cv.pdf) or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-sbw1JIAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Research Interests

I am interested in *probabilistic machine learning* methods, including the development and evaluation of probabilistic models, as well as design of approximate inference methods.
