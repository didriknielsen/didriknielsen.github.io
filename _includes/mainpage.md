## About Me

Researcher at [Norwegian Computing Center](https://nr.no/en/) solving research problems for industry using machine learning.

Previously, I was working with Prof. [Ole Winther](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/winther/) on *deep generative models* at [DTU Compute](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english) in Copenhagen and before that I worked with [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) on *approximate Bayesian inference* at [RIKEN AIP](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) in Tokyo.

For more details, see my full [CV](/files/cv.pdf) or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-sbw1JIAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Research Interests

I am interested in *probabilistic machine learning* methods and *deep learning*, including variational inference, deep generative models and neural architecture design.
