## About Me

I recently joined [DTU Compute](http://www.compute.dtu.dk/english) as a research assistant in Copenhagen, Denmark, working with Prof. [Ole Winther](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/winther/).
Here, I will work on a project with the start-up [raffle.ai](http://raffle.ai/) using natural language processing, deep learning and active learning to develop corporate virtual assistants.

Previously, I was working at [AIP](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) at RIKEN in Tokyo, Japan with [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) on methods for approximate Bayesian inference.

<!-- Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP)](http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/) at RIKEN in Tokyo, Japan.
At AIP, I was working with [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io/) on methods for approximate Bayesian inference, with a focus on variational methods and Bayesian deep learning. -->

For more details, see my full [CV](/files/cv.pdf).

## Research Interests

I am interested in *probabilistic machine learning* methods, including the development and evaluation of probabilistic models, as well as design of approximate inference methods.

<!-- More specifically, my recent work has been related to:
* Variational inference
* Deep learning
* Natural gradient methods -->
